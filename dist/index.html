    <p class="text-center lead">You've been making task lists wrong your whole life and you didn't even know it!</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6 left vertical-center">
      <p>Millions of people make task lists everyday, but few of them realize that the way they are making and using
        them is wrong. There are two fundamental mistakes people make when making lists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6 right">
      <h4 class="text-center"><strong>You make your list, but you don't refer back to it as you're accomplishing it.</strong></h4>
      <p class="text-center">and</p>
      <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Task lists are written from the top down,<br/>
        but you need to accomplish it from the bottom up.</strong></h4>
      <!--<h4 class="text-center">but you need to accomplish it from the bottom up.</strong></h4>-->
    </div>

    <p>You see just writing your list isn't enough. You need to keep referring back to it to make sure that you stay on
      point and don't deviate. To accomplish those tasks you also need to start with the smallest possible step, or in other words, the last items on that list.</p>

      <h2 class="input">Write your lists like you normally would.</h2>

      <p>Write your lists in the way that you are accustomed to. The application will give you simple hints for better lists and prompt you to break them down to their smallest possible components. By doing this you will be able to tackle any project from the ground up.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 sub-input">
      <h2 class="output">The application outputs it in a more meaningful way.</h2>

      <p>Once you have inputed all of the steps you need to take to accomplish your task, the application will create a list that better reflects the order in which things will need to get done. The more information that you give the application about your tasks - for example: when they are due, how long they might take to accomplish - the better it will be able to prioritize them for you.</p>

  <p>To help you stay on top of your lists the application outputs visually engaging information about the state that they are in. By engaging you, the user, the application seeks to keep you coming back to update your progress.</p>

  <h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>As I approached graduation I started developing this task list application as a capstone to showcase the things that I had learned. I started with just the idea and progressed it through strategy, wireframing, prototyping and mock-ups.</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>I am a graphic and web designer living in Kansas City. After sixteen years in the culinary field, I am taking my creative talents and eye for detail and applying them to design. I just graduated with a Bachelors of Arts in Graphic and Web Design at The Art Institutes International-Kansas City. I am specifically interested in user experience design as I feel it is one of the most important, but often neglected aspects of design. In my years in the culinary field, I learned the importance of peoples' perception of a product or service. I want to take the attention to detail that I learned in that field and apply it to apps and the web.</p>
